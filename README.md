# Ensuring-road-and-pedestrian-safety-using-computer-vision-and-data-fusion

This repository provides the main codes used in the work published here: https://smartech.gatech.edu/handle/1853/61313

The objective of this work is to describe, detect and quantify the frequency of near-accidents and dangerous behaviors involving pedestrians using computer vision and data fusion techniques

The document Domitille Commun_MasterThesisPoster summaize the work done.

The main codes are shared on this github.
A first set of codes enables the automated traffic and pedestrian data collection through the use of computer vision.
A second set of codes enables the traffic and pedestrian data analysis through the use of data fusion.
